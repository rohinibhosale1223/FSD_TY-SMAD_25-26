      <h2 className="text-warning mb-3 fw-bold">About DSA Learning</h2>

      <p>
        Learning Data Structures and Algorithms can feel overwhelming at first. 
        Concepts like recursion, greedy methods, or dynamic programming often seem complex 
        until they’re broken down properly. That’s exactly why we created 
        <span className="text-warning"> DSA Learning</span> — a simple, clean and friendly 
        platform where students can understand DSA concepts at their own pace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of long, complicated explanations, we focus on helping you learn through 
        clear visuals, real-life examples, and structured topics. Whether you’re preparing 
        for your semester exams, coding interviews, or simply trying to improve your logic 
        building, this platform is designed to support you every step of the way.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-warning mt-4">What You’ll Find Here</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy-to-follow explanations for core topics like Arrays, Trees, Graphs, and more.</li>
        <li>Well-designed course cards with images to make learning visually engaging.</li>
        <li>Beginner-friendly content — no prior knowledge required.</li>
        <li>Add-to-Cart system so you can save the courses you want to study.</li>
        <li>A smooth and responsive interface built using React and Bootstrap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-warning mt-4">Why We Built This</h4>
      <p>
        Many students struggle with DSA not because they are weak in coding, 
        but because the concepts are usually taught in a very rushed or complicated way. 
        We wanted to change that. Our goal is to make DSA feel approachable and enjoyable, 
        rather than scary or difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, you can explore each topic slowly, understand the logic behind it, 
        and apply it through practice problems. The more you explore, the more confident you become.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-warning mt-4">Our Vision</h4>
      <p>
        We aim to create a space where every student — whether from CS, IT, AIML, or any other branch — 
        can learn DSA in a stress-free way. We want to help you build strong fundamentals that will 
        support you in placements, internships, and even future projects.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-warning mt-4">What’s Coming Next?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A personalized dashboard to track your learning progress.</li>
        <li>A built-in code editor to practice problems in real-time.</li>
        <li>Topic-wise quizzes with instant feedback.</li>
        <li>Achievements and certificates for completed courses.</li>
        <li>Dark and light mode options for better comfort.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-4">
        At the end of the day, our mission is simple — 
        <span className="text-warning"> help you understand DSA in a way that finally makes sense.</span>  
        One concept at a time.
